# Based on http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitwise_IO#Python, with changes by Rolf
# Fagerberg.

# Bits are represented by ints, which in Python can be thougth of as infinite
# bitstrings of the form ...000001XXXXXXXXX (positive ints) or ...111110XXXXXXX
# (negative ints). In all situations in the code below, some suffix (of length
# 1, 8, or n) of such bitstrings is the bits in question.

# The code is always passing from left to right in the sequence of bits,
# e.g. when writing to/reading from a byte, or if writing n bits (i.e., these
# will be the rigthmost n bits of the int supplied).

# For writing, note that when flush() is called, a full byte will be written to
# the file by right-filling the byte with 0's (because the accumulator is reset
# to 0 (= ......0000000) after each write). This is the intended
# functionality. If on the other hand flush() is not called after writing has
# finished , the last bits written (up to 7) may be lost.

# If a BitWriter is instantiated via a "with ... as ..." statement, flush()
# will automatically be called (via the __exit__() method).
