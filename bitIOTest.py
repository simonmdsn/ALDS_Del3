# Test program to exercise bitIO.BitReader and bitIO.BitWriter. Run it
# on some small text file (containing at least 4 bytes) by
# 
#   python test.py infilename outfilename
# 
# This should copy the infile to outfile, while adding the character
# '@' to the end of it (after any newline, if the file ends with
# this), and along the way write some multi-digit integer to the
# screen (read comments below to understand WHY this should be the
# behavior).

# Open input and output files, using binary mode (reading/writing bytes).
infile = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb')
outfile = open(sys.argv[2], 'wb')

# Create the BitReader/BitWriter using these files as input/output.

bitstreamout = bitIO.BitWriter(outfile)

# First read a full int (i.e., four bytes) from the input file using the
# library method readint32bits.
i = bitstreamin.readint32bits()

# Print the value on screen (probably multi-digit integer, if run on a
# textfile, since four bytes representing some chars are the bit pattern of
# some 32 bit integer).
print(i)

# Write the int again to output file (as same four bytes, so bytes should
# appear again in output file exactly as they were in input file) using the
# library method writeint32bits().
bitstreamout.writeint32bits(i)

# Now read the last bits of input file. Do this bit by bit using the library
# method readbit(). At the same time write them again on the output file using
# the library method writebit(). Note the while-expression going through the
# file until no more bits are available (signaled by readsucces() returning
# false).

# Write two bits MORE to output file. This will be padded by the library with
# six 0 bits when flushing the output stream, hence give the character '@'
# (which in ASCII has pattern 01000000).
bitstreamout.writebit(0)
bitstreamout.writebit(1)

# Flush the BitWriter (automatically padding output with 0-bits until a full
# number of bytes (i.e, a multiple of eight bits) have been written, as
# described above) and close the files.
